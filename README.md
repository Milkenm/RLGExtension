In case you didn't know, [Epic is removing trading](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/removing-playertoplayer-trading-in-december/) from Rocket League on December 5, so there is no point in continuing the development of this extension.

If you want to know what this extension was for: it added a lil "Bump All" button to [RL Garage](https://rocket-league.com/) trades page, so you didn't have to go to every trade and bump it manually. Prices below the items was in-dev, based on [Rocket League Insider](https://rl.insider.gg/).
